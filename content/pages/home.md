While drumming and percussion is an age old practice throughout humanity, women have been excluded from it in many cultures in the last several hundred years.  â€‹

In "When the Drummers were Women: A Spiritual History of Rhythm," Layne Redmond shares careful research about the history of women as drummers and leaders of rituals. 

The She Drums project explores the taboo around female drumming in many different cultures, including the United States, and paints a picture of how many women drummers have paved the way for the craft to be more commonly accepted. There are now millions of female drummers around the world, and it's a fast growing "movement."

We also explore the themes of how women developed as drummers from childhood or later in life, obstacles they face in advancing as professionals, the different uses of drumming, and more.
